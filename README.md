### Planning
### Picture_Sketching
### Base

note: I had written a lot on here, but it appears that I'd forgotten to save my work so it's all mostly gone :(

I started by tracing out what 2D dimmensions the reference pics were giving me. At first, I figured I could use exactly that to form elipses that fit into them to be used as loft planes. But i then realized i just needed to figure out the general shape of the solid, then use that as a loft plane. For the base, I thought it looked almost like a saddle, so i used a spline with a flatter top to sorta form it.

Had some mishaps with extend entities. just had to undo them and manually extend them.
